# Predict the 2025 Masters Winner ‚Äì A Machine Learning & Sports Analytics Project

Welcome to a collaborative, hands-on project where we use real-world sports data and machine learning to predict the winner of the 2025 Masters Tournament (April 10‚Äì13, 2025). The goal isn‚Äôt just to build a winning model‚Äîit‚Äôs to learn, experiment, and grow together.

## 4-Week Learning Plan

### Week 1: Data Collection & Setup
- **Understand the Problem:** Discuss what makes a good golf prediction model.
- **Data Gathering:** Collect historical Masters data, player stats, and course details.
- **Setup:** Establish a GitHub repo and collaboration tools.
- **Brainstorm:** Start exploring feature engineering ideas.

*Goal:* A structured dataset ready for analysis.

### Week 2: Data Exploration & Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess and standardize data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features (e.g., strokes gained trends, Augusta experience).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and uncover patterns.
- **Model Discussion:** Explore potential ML models and approaches.

*Goal:* A refined dataset with insightful features.

### Week 3: Model Training & Experimentation
- **Modeling:** Experiment with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.
- **Tuning:** Learn hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.
- **Validation:** Use cross-validation and compare predictions against historical data and betting odds.
- **Iteration:** Adjust features and parameters based on initial results.

*Goal:* A working model and a deeper understanding of performance drivers.

### Week 4: Learning from Results & Sharing Insights
- **Reflection:** Analyze what worked (and what didn‚Äôt) to inform future improvements.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Build a simple visualization/dashboard (Flask/Streamlit) to display predictions.
- **Documentation:** Summarize key takeaways and share them on GitHub & LinkedIn.
- **Feedback:** Exchange recommendations to support each other‚Äôs growth.

*Goal:* Not just a prediction model, but a robust learning experience to showcase.
