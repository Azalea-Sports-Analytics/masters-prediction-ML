# Russell's 1st suggestion for scoring
This is based entirely on game play.

It does not include any other factors.

## Step 1: Find the universe of players & scored golf tournaments
## Step 2: Select the players & scored tournaments of interest
## Step 3: For every pair of players of interest compute and expected-delta and importance-of-delta

expected-delta is the average stroke difference between the two players across all the matches that they both competed in.

importance-of-delta is the number of matches that they both competed in.

## Step 4: Assign players scores such that the difference between each pair of players is close to the expected-data

Method (A.1) is what Russell was presuming existed.

Method (A.5) was what Russell had mind as a naive implementation.

Below are several approaches you can consider to accomplish **Step 4**—that is, assigning player scores so that for every pair of players, the difference in their scores is as close as possible to the computed expected delta (with importance-of-delta acting as a weight). Each method translates the pairwise constraints into a solvable mathematical or algorithmic framework:

---


#### 1. **Weighted Least-Squares Minimization**

- **Concept:**  
  Set up an objective function that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the actual score differences and the expected deltas, weighting each error by the importance (number of matches).

- **Implementation:**  
  Define player scores \( s_i \) for each player \( i \) and minimize:
  \[
  \text{Objective} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{P}} w_{ij} \left( (s_i - s_j) - \Delta_{ij} \right)^2
  \]
  where:
  - \( \Delta_{ij} \) is the average stroke difference (expected delta) between players \( i \) and \( j \).
  - \( w_{ij} \) is the importance-of-delta (number of matches).
  
- **Pros:**  
  - Straightforward formulation.
  - Can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques or dedicated optimization libraries.

---

#### 2. **Quadratic Programming (QP)**

- **Concept:**  
  The least-squares objective above is quadratic in the player scores. You can frame this as a quadratic programming problem, which allows you to add additional constraints.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Express the objective in standard QP form.
  - Introduce constraints if needed (for example, fixing one player’s score to remove ambiguity or bounding the scores within a specific range).

- **Pros:**  
  - Flexibility to incorporate extra constraints.
  - Utilizes efficient QP solvers available in many software packages.

---

#### 3. **Graph-Based Spectral Ranking**

- **Concept:**  
  Represent players as nodes in a graph, with weighted edges representing the expected differences. Then, use spectral methods to derive a one-dimensional embedding that respects these weights.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Build a graph where the edge between player \( i \) and \( j \) is assigned weight \( w_{ij} \) and a “distance” of \( \Delta_{ij} \).
  - Apply spectral embedding (e.g., Laplacian eigenmaps) to project the players onto a one-dimensional axis.
  
- **Pros:**  
  - Naturally handles the relational structure between players.
  - Offers insights from the graph structure (such as clusters of similar performance).

---

#### 4. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**

- **Concept:**  
  Adapt classical MDS to the one-dimensional case by treating the expected deltas as distances between points (players).

- **Implementation:**  
  - Input the matrix of expected differences (possibly weighted by importance) into an MDS algorithm.
  - The algorithm finds a one-dimensional configuration of points that minimizes the stress (the discrepancy between the given distances and the distances in the embedded space).

- **Pros:**  
  - Provides a geometric interpretation of player differences.
  - Well-suited when you have a complete set of pairwise measurements.

---

#### 5. **Iterative Refinement / Gradient Descent**

- **Concept:**  
  Begin with an initial guess for the player scores and iteratively adjust them to reduce the error in pairwise differences.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Define the same weighted least-squares error function.
  - Use gradient descent or another iterative optimization technique to update the scores:
    \[
    s_i \leftarrow s_i - \alpha \frac{\partial \text{Objective}}{\partial s_i}
    \]
  - Iterate until the changes become negligibly small.

- **Pros:**  
  - Flexible and can be scaled for larger datasets.
  - Can easily incorporate non-linear constraints or adjustments if needed.

---

#### 6. **Direct Over-Determined System of Equations**

- **Concept:**  
  Express each pairwise expected difference as an equation:
  \[
  s_i - s_j \approx \Delta_{ij}
  \]
  Since there will typically be more equations than unknowns (and the system is likely inconsistent), find the best-fit solution.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Assemble the system into matrix form.
  - Use the pseudoinverse (via Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) to compute the least-squares solution.
  
- **Pros:**  
  - Directly leverages linear algebra.
  - Can be computationally efficient for moderate-sized systems.

---

#### 7. **Bayesian Inference Approach**

- **Concept:**  
  Treat the player scores as latent variables in a probabilistic model. Assume that the observed pairwise differences are noisy observations of the true differences between scores.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Specify a likelihood function such as:
    \[
    \Delta_{ij}^{\text{obs}} \sim \mathcal{N}(s_i - s_j, \sigma^2)
    \]
  - Use Bayesian methods (e.g., Maximum a Posteriori estimation or Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to infer the posterior distribution of the scores.
  
- **Pros:**  
  - Allows incorporation of prior knowledge about player performance.
  - Provides uncertainty estimates for the scores.

---

#### 8. **Optimization with Regularization**

- **Concept:**  
  Enhance the basic least-squares or QP formulation by adding a regularization term to prevent overfitting—especially important if some pairs have very few matches.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Modify the objective to include a penalty on the magnitude of the scores (or differences):
    \[
    \text{Objective} = \sum_{(i,j)} w_{ij} \left( (s_i - s_j) - \Delta_{ij} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_i s_i^2
    \]
  - Adjust the regularization parameter \( \lambda \) based on cross-validation or other model selection criteria.

- **Pros:**  
  - Improves stability in cases with sparse data.
  - Controls the overall scale or variability of the scores.

---

#### **Summary of Key Points**

- **Goal:** Assign scores \( s_i \) so that for each pair \((i, j)\), the difference \( s_i - s_j \) closely approximates the computed \( \Delta_{ij} \), weighted by the importance-of-delta \( w_{ij} \).
- **Core Methods:**  
  - **Optimization-Based Approaches:** Weighted least-squares, quadratic programming, and iterative refinement.
  - **Embedding and Graph Methods:** Spectral ranking and MDS to find a one-dimensional representation.
  - **Direct Linear Algebra:** Solving an over-determined system using SVD.
  - **Probabilistic Methods:** Bayesian inference to account for uncertainty and prior information.
  - **Regularization:** Enhancing robustness by penalizing extreme scores.
  
Each approach offers its own advantages, and the best choice depends on factors like the size of your dataset, the presence of additional constraints, and whether you need uncertainty estimates.

---

These methods provide a toolkit for addressing the challenge in **Step 4**. Depending on your specific requirements (such as computational resources, data sparsity, or the need for incorporating additional constraints), you can select or combine these techniques to achieve robust and accurate player scoring.
